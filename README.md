## About

This mod displays boss titles in higher resolution (4x) and allows you to customize character boss titles without any code at all (just edit the mod config). The customization is intended to use with mods that change character models or just for memes.

Main features:
* All boss title textures remade from scratch in 4x resolution (note: most of the vanilla textures were really badly drawn, especially the ones from SOC for the 2012 version).
* Boss HP gauge also remade in 4x.
* All boss titles have edited setups in the code, including GUN Robo and other non-character bosses.
* All boss titles are set to be properly centered on the screen (the vanilla character titles were slightly off-centered because of non-zero Spacing parameter in boss title data structures and that parameter affects the last letter as well).
* Default character titles are customizable via mod config. Supported letters: Latin alphabet (case-insensitive), digits, space, dot, apostrophe, exclamation and question marks. If the set title have other letters, they will be skipped. Empty titles will be replaced with the default ones.
* Customizable boss titles have auto-calculated spacing (to fit the screen properly) and display time. But I wouldn't recommend making very long titles, ~20 letters should be enough for 16:9 aspect ratio.
* Two graphic styles: PC (vanilla) and Dreamcast/Gamecube (for King Boom Boo, The Biolizard and The Finalhazard).
* Fixed a lot of typos in GUN Robo specs (mostly made by SOC).
